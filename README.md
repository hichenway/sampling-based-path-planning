# RRT and Pruning

This code provides a implementation of  RRT and Pruning.

RRT is a path planning algorithm based on random sampling. It can search the whole state space quickly and is widely used to the high-dimensional problems.

Pruning is a simple but efficient algorithm thought.It's intention is to avoid unnecessary search and opearation, or to clip unnecessary parts in result to gain better effect.

Additionally, this code requires the installation of several python libraries, namely:

	- shapely
	- numpy
	- yaml
	- matplotlib
	- descartes
